## Release model

[Create an OCDS release](../operations.md#create-a-release) for each `/OBJECT_CONTRACT` (*Object*) element. (If the notice is for prior information only, then the `/OBJECT_CONTRACT` (*Object*) element is repeatable. The release corresponding to each element will have a different `ocid`.)
