**Quick links:** [PDF form](https://ted.europa.eu/documents/d/ted/en_f20) | [sample XML](https://github.com/open-contracting/european-union-support/blob/main/output/samples/F20_2014.xml)

F20 is about modifications to the *contract* or *concession*.

Similar to [F14](F14), the European Commission in its [eForms consultation](https://github.com/eForms/eForms) proposes to republish notices – adding a short section to summarize and justify the modification – instead of using F20 ([see discussion](https://github.com/eForms/eForms/issues/45)).

<!--
As described in [this discussion](https://github.com/eForms/eForms/issues/306), a modification notice informs about the *modification*, not about the object as a whole. For example, it can inform about: a new place of performance, without restating all places of performance; the duration of the modification, without updating the duration of the contract; the CPV code for an antenna, without restating the CPV code for the vehicle.

## Release model

[Create an OCDS release](../operations.md#create-a-release) and:

1. Add 'awardUpdate' and 'contractUpdate' to `tag`.

## What's new

If you have already implemented all prior forms, this notice adds:

* <a href="#VII">VII</a> Modifications to the contract/concession

Unlike [F03](F03) and [F06](F06), F20 discards `/AWARD_CONTRACT/AWARDED_CONTRACT/VALUES` (<a href="#V.2.4">V.2.4</a> *Information on value of the contract/lot/concession*), since it will have been disclosed in an F03 or F06, and since F20 maps `/MODIFICATIONS_CONTRACT/DESCRIPTION_PROCUREMENT/VALUES` (<a href="#VII.1.6">VII.1.6</a> *Information on value of the contract/lot/concession*) to the same OCDS fields.

The wording of some mappings is changed, without consequence:

* <a href="#/PROCEDURE/NOTICE_NUMBER_OJ"><code>/PROCEDURE/NOTICE_NUMBER_OJ</code></a> (*Notice number in the OJ S*) always refers to a contract award notice on F20, but can refer to a prior information notice or periodic indicative notice (PIN) on other forms. Other forms therefore describe what to do if it is a PIN.
* <a href="#/AWARD_CONTRACT/CONTRACT_NO"><code>/AWARD_CONTRACT/CONTRACT_NO</code></a> (*Contract No*) is mandatory on F20, but optional on other forms. Other forms therefore describe what to do if it isn't set.

## Other notes

The PDF form has radio buttons for the legal basis, which correspond to a single unlabeled XML element (`/LEGAL_BASIS`).
