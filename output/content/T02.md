## Release model

[Create an OCDS release](../operations.md#create-a-release) and:

1. Add 'award' and 'contract' to `tag`.
1. Set `tender.status` to 'complete'.

## What's new

If you have already implemented all prior forms, this notice adds:

* <a href="#II.4">II.4</a> Essential assets
* Fields to <a href="#III">III</a> Legal, economic, financial and technical information
* <a href="#V.2.3">V.2.3</a> Indications about ownership of the selected operator
* <a href="#V.2.3">V.2.3</a> Name and address of the party or parties exercising legal control over the selected operator
* <a href="#V.2.4">V.2.4</a> Kilometres of public passenger transport services

Unlike [F03](F03) and [F06](F06), T02 has no `/AWARD_CONTRACT/CONTRACT_NO` (*Contract No*). As such, the mapping to the award's `.id` is described in <a href="#/AWARD_CONTRACT"><code>/AWARD_CONTRACT</code></a> (*Award of contract*).
