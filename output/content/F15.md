**Quick links:** [PDF form](https://ted.europa.eu/documents/d/ted/en_f15) | [sample XML](https://github.com/open-contracting/european-union-support/blob/main/output/samples/F15_2014.xml)

## Release model

[Create an OCDS release](../operations.md#create-a-release) and:

1. Add 'award' and 'contract' to `tag`.
1. Set `tender.status` to 'complete'.

## What's new

If you have already implemented all *other* forms, this notice adds no new concepts, but inserts one of `DIRECTIVE_2014_23_EU`, `DIRECTIVE_2014_24_EU`, `DIRECTIVE_2014_25_EU` or `DIRECTIVE_2009_81_EC` into some of the XML paths.

## Other notes

The PDF form has radio buttons for the legal basis, which correspond to a single unlabeled XML element (`/LEGAL_BASIS`).
