**Quick links:** [PDF form](https://ted.europa.eu/documents/d/ted/en_f23) | [sample XML](https://github.com/open-contracting/european-union-support/blob/main/output/samples/F23_2014.xml)

## Release model

[Create an OCDS release](../operations.md#create-a-release).

## What's new

If you have already implemented all prior forms, this notice adds:

* [Preamble](#preamble)
* Fields to <a href="#IV.1.1">IV.1.1</a> Form of procedure
* Fields to <a href="#V.2.4">V.2.4</a> Information on value of the concession and main financing terms
* [Annex D4](#annex-d4-concession) Concession

Unlike [F03](F03) and [F06](F06), F23 has no `/AWARD_CONTRACT/CONTRACT_NO` (*Contract No*). As such, the mapping to the award's `.id` is described in <a href="#/AWARD_CONTRACT"><code>/AWARD_CONTRACT</code></a> (*Award of concession*).

In the PDF, unlike [F15](F15), F23 has no index for `/AWARD_CONTRACT/AWARDED_CONTRACT` and no label for `AWARD_CONTRACT/AWARDED_CONTRACT/CONTRACTORS`.
