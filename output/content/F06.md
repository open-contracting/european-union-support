## Release model

[Create an OCDS release](../operations.md#create-a-release) and:

1. Add 'award' and 'contract' to `tag`.
1. If the notice has one or more `/AWARD_CONTRACT/AWARDED_CONTRACT` (*A contract/lot is awarded*) elements, set `tender.status` to 'complete'. Otherwise, if the notice has one or more `/AWARD_CONTRACT/NO_AWARDED_CONTRACT/PROCUREMENT_UNSUCCESSFUL` (*No tenders or requests to participate were received or all were rejected*) elements, set `tender.status` to 'unsuccessful'. Otherwise, set `tender.status` to 'cancelled'.
