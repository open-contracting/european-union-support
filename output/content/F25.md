**Quick links:** [PDF form](https://simap.ted.europa.eu/documents/10184/99173/EN_F25.pdf) | [sample XML](https://github.com/open-contracting/european-union-support/blob/main/output/samples/F25_2014.xml)

## Release model

[Create an OCDS release](../operations.md#create-a-release) and:

1. Add 'award' and 'contract' to `tag`.
1. If the notice has one or more `/AWARD_CONTRACT/AWARDED_CONTRACT` (*A concession/lot is awarded*) elements, set `tender.status` to 'complete'. Otherwise, if the notice has one or more `/AWARD_CONTRACT/NO_AWARDED_CONTRACT/PROCUREMENT_UNSUCCESSFUL` (*No tenders or requests to participate were received or all were rejected*) elements, set `tender.status` to 'unsuccessful'. Otherwise, set `tender.status` to 'cancelled'.

## What's new

If you have already implemented all prior forms, this notice adds:

* <a href="#II.1.5">II.1.5</a> Method used for calculating the estimated value of the concession

Unlike [F03](F03) and [F06](F06), F23 has no `/AWARD_CONTRACT/CONTRACT_NO` (*Contract No*). As such, the mapping to the award's `.id` is described in <a href="#/AWARD_CONTRACT"><code>/AWARD_CONTRACT</code></a> (*Award of concession*).

In the PDF, unlike [F15](F15), F25 has no index for `/AWARD_CONTRACT/AWARDED_CONTRACT` and no label for `AWARD_CONTRACT/AWARDED_CONTRACT/CONTRACTORS`.
